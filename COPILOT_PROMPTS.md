# Copilot & AI Prompts — Documentation helpers

Short description
-----------------
Useful prompts you or interns can use with Copilot or an LLM to draft documentation, onboarding content, templates, and setup guides. These are starting prompts — always verify and adapt generated content.

## General doc drafting

- "Write a 1-page PRD for a mobile e‑commerce checkout feature. Include problem, succes metrics, acceptance criteria, timeline, and dependencies. Use simple language and a short example user flow."
- "Convert the following notes into a clear `Getting Started` guide with copy-paste commands and troubleshooting tips: [paste notes]."

## Tech-specific setup

- "Create a step-by-step `Setup.md` for a Flutter developer new to the team. Include SDK install, common commands, and a troubleshooting section."
- "Write a `Setup.md` for a Python API service using Poetry and PostgreSQL, with commands to create a virtual environment and run migrations."

## Template population

- "Fill this PRD template for a feature that reduces signup friction: [paste PRD_TEMPLATE.md]. Provide example acceptance criteria and sample metrics."

## Onboarding snippets

- "Write a short onboarding checklist for a new intern who will work on the frontend: environment, key repos, coding standards, who to ping for help."

## Editing & style

- "Rewrite the following paragraph to match a friendly, encouraging tone and follow the STYLE_GUIDE.md rules: [paste paragraph]."

## Verification

- "List quick health checks to verify a deployment succeeded for a web app: endpoints to call, metrics to check, and logs to inspect."

## Prompt tips

- Provide examples and expected outputs when possible.
- Ask the model to produce small, testable outputs (short commands, 1–2 paragraphs) rather than long essays.
