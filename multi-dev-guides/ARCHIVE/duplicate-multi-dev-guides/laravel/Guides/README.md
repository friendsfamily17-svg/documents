# Laravel Developer Guides (Overview)

Short index for Laravel docs in this repository. Canonical, project-focused documents live here:

- multi-dev-guides/startup-dev-guides/docs/laravel/

Use the files under that folder for design specifics, deployment checklists, and CI/CD configuration.

Official docs: https://laravel.com/docs

Contributions should update the files in `startup-dev-guides/docs/laravel/`.
