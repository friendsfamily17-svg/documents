Microservices Guides

Guidance for building small, focused services and running them together: service discovery, API gateway, containerization, and observability.

Canonical docs and processes live under the startup handbook here:

- Project process: `../../startup-dev-guides/docs/microservices/PROCESS.md`
- Example scenarios: `../../startup-dev-guides/docs/microservices/SCENARIOS.md`
- Templates (PRD, SDD, deployment): `../../startup-dev-guides/templates/`

See `Guides/Setup.md` for local orchestration tips and `Guides/CommonErrors.md` for common distributed-system pitfalls.
