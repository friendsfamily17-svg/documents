# Multi-Dev Guides

Welcome to the Multi-Dev Guides project! This repository contains a collection of guides and documentation tailored for developers across various technologies.

Important — canonical docs

The detailed, canonical per‑tech documentation is located under `startup-dev-guides/docs/`. The lightweight `Guides/README.md` files in the top-level tech folders point to these canonical docs, but to save clicks you can open the canonical folders directly:

- Flutter: `multi-dev-guides/startup-dev-guides/docs/flutter/`
- Python: `multi-dev-guides/startup-dev-guides/docs/python/`
- Laravel: `multi-dev-guides/startup-dev-guides/docs/laravel/`
- React: `multi-dev-guides/startup-dev-guides/docs/react/`

Quick links (short)
