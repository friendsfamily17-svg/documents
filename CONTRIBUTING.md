# Contributing

Short description
-----------------
This file explains how to suggest changes, name files, and submit pull requests. It's written for interns and new contributors so you can get started quickly.

## How to suggest a change

1. Search the repo to see if the topic already exists.
2. If it doesn't exist, open an issue describing the change with a short motivation and example.
3. If you prefer to code the change, create a branch and open a draft PR — add "WIP" to the title until it's ready for review.

## Branch & naming conventions

- Branches: use `feature/<short-description>` or `fix/<short-description>` (e.g., `feature/add-flutter-setup`).
- Files: use clear, kebab-case names for new files (e.g., `setup.md`, `common-errors.md`).
- Directories: place per‑tech guides under `multi-dev-guides/<tech>/Guides/` or update canonical docs under `multi-dev-guides/startup-dev-guides/docs/<tech>/`.

## Pull request process

1. Create a small, focused PR (one topic per PR).
2. Link related issue(s) and the PRD/Design if relevant.
3. Add a short description of what changed and why.
4. Assign at least one reviewer (a mentor or team lead). Use draft PRs for in-progress work.
5. When ready, remove WIP and request review.

## Documentation quality checklist

- Is the content accurate and actionable?
- Does it follow `STYLE_GUIDE.md`? (tone, headings, examples)
- Are links internal and working?
- Is there a short example or scenario to explain the concept?

## New contributors — tips

- Start by fixing small things (typos, formatting, missing links). These help you learn the repo structure and get quick feedback.
- If you are unsure about scope, open an issue first and ask for guidance.

Thank you — contributions make this handbook better for everyone.
