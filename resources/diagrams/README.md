# Diagrams — how to store architecture diagrams

Short description
-----------------
This folder is a placeholder for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams and handoff visuals. Keep diagrams versioned and include a short text summary explaining each diagram.

Guidelines

- Store source files (drawio, figma export) alongside an exported PNG/SVG.
- Name files clearly: `component-auth-flow.drawio`, `checkout-sequence.png`.
- Include a one-line caption and a short README entry describing what the diagram shows.
