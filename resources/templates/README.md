# Templates — quick reference

Short description
-----------------
This folder holds document templates you can copy into a project: PRD, SDD, TSD, Test Plan and Deployment Checklist. Use them as a starting point and adapt to your project.

## Available templates

- `PRD_TEMPLATE.md` — product requirements with acceptance criteria and success metrics.
- `SDD_TEMPLATE.md` / `SDD_TEMPLATE_EXPANDED.md` — implementation design guidance.
- `TSD_TEMPLATE.md` / `TSD_TEMPLATE_EXPANDED.md` — tech stack and API/contracts.
- `TEST_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md` / `TEST_PLAN_TEMPLATE_EXPANDED.md` — QA strategy and traceability.
- `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` / `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST_EXPANDED.md` — release steps and rollback guidance.

## How to use

1. Copy the template into your project repo (e.g., `docs/PRD.md`).
2. Fill in the Project Understanding, Acceptance Criteria and Traceability sections.
3. Link the filled template to the issue or PR for traceability.
