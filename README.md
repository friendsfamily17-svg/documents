# Startup Dev Guides — Onboarding & Playbooks

Welcome — this repo is a friendly handbook for interns, new hires and startup teams. It explains not just how to code, but how teams plan, document, build, test and ship software in the real world.

## What's inside

- Canonical per‑tech playbooks: `multi-dev-guides/startup-dev-guides/docs/<tech>/` (Flutter, Python, Laravel, React).
- Templates: PRD, TSD, SDD, Test Plans and Deployment Checklists in `multi-dev-guides/startup-dev-guides/templates/`.
- Helpful process docs: onboarding, lifecycle, CI/CD, QA, release and scenarios.

## Ideal for

- Interns and new developers learning professional workflows.
- Startup engineers who want a quick, practical reference for releases and onboarding.
- Product folks and PMs who need to understand developer expectations and deliverables.

## Quick start

1. Open a tech folder (e.g., `multi-dev-guides/startup-dev-guides/docs/flutter/README.md`) and follow the `ONBOARDING.md`.
2. Use templates in `multi-dev-guides/startup-dev-guides/templates/` when writing PRDs, SDDs, or test plans.
3. If something is missing, check `CONTRIBUTING.md` and open an issue or submit a PR.

## Contributing

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for how to suggest changes, naming conventions, and the PR process. We welcome small, well-documented contributions from interns — start with a draft PR or an issue describing the change.

## AI & Copilot Usage

We encourage using Copilot and AI to draft docs. See `COPILOT_PROMPTS.md` for useful prompts and examples. Always review AI output for accuracy and adapt the language to our style (`STYLE_GUIDE.md`).
