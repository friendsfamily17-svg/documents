# Startup Dev Guides — Onboarding & Playbooks

Welcome — this repo is a friendly handbook for interns, new hires and startup teams. It explains not just how to code, but how teams plan, document, build, test and ship software in the real world.

## Quick Start for Interns

1. Read this `README.md` to get oriented.
2. Open the tech playbook for your stack (links in the Navigation table below) and follow `ONBOARDING.md`.
3. Make a small change (fix a typo or add a short example). Open a draft PR and request a mentor review — see `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## What's Inside

- Canonical per‑tech playbooks: `multi-dev-guides/startup-dev-guides/docs/<tech>/` (Flutter, Python, Laravel, React).
- Templates: PRD, TSD, SDD, Test Plans and Deployment Checklists in `multi-dev-guides/startup-dev-guides/templates/`.
- Resources: `resources/templates/` (ready-to-copy templates) and `resources/diagrams/` (diagram guidance and placeholders).

## How to Use These Docs

- Follow `ONBOARDING.md` in your tech folder to set up your environment.
- Use `PROCESS.md` and `SCENARIOS.md` to understand intake-to-delivery flows.
- Copy templates into your project repo and fill the "Project Understanding" and acceptance criteria sections before development.

## AI & Copilot Usage

We encourage using Copilot and AI to draft docs. See `COPILOT_PROMPTS.md` for useful prompts and examples. Always review AI output for accuracy and adapt the language to our style (`STYLE_GUIDE.md`).

## Where to look next

If you're an intern, start with one small doc change (typo, formatting, short example) and open a draft PR — we'll review it together.
