# Startup Dev Guides (Documentation Index)

This repository contains onboarding and development guides tailored for startup teams and new developers across multiple technologies (Flutter, Python, Laravel, React).

Quick links (open these first)

- Flutter (canonical): multi-dev-guides/startup-dev-guides/docs/flutter/
- Python (canonical): multi-dev-guides/startup-dev-guides/docs/python/
- Laravel (canonical): multi-dev-guides/startup-dev-guides/docs/laravel/
- React (canonical): multi-dev-guides/startup-dev-guides/docs/react/

Getting started (for new hires / interns)

1. Pick your tech above and open the `README.md` in that folder (it contains setup and onboarding steps).
2. Read `multi-dev-guides/STARTUP_DEV_GUIDE.md` for the overarching process and essential documents (PRD, TSD, SDD, test plans).
3. Follow the per-tech `ONBOARDING.md` for environment setup and quick-start commands.

If you don't see something you need, open an issue or submit a PR — the canonical docs live under `multi-dev-guides/startup-dev-guides/docs/`.
